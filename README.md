# Marketing-s-Secret-Weapon-Visual-Communication

**Visual communication**: visually displays information in order to efficiently and effectively establish meaning. When required, little text is included to explain the meaning. Simply defined, visual communication is about letting the visuals tell the narrative first, therefore whatever piece of content you create will be communicated via the design, illustration options, data visualizations, process illustrations, and so forth. 

Without words, visual communication tells our story. The absence of text should be a hallmark of any effective visual communication. Simply looking at the graphics should be enough for someone to grasp the gist of what's being discussed or conveyed in order to continue reading.

### Why visuals are important 

Visuals may be a terrific method to understand someone's emotions, and the purest visual communication occurs when we have something that drives with emotion first and language second.

### Data Visualization 

 Data visualizations have become increasingly popular in recent years. They aid people in making quick decisions and taking action on them. Today, we have access to so much information at our fingertips. People have begun to rely significantly on high-quality data visualizations to make sense of all this data. What works and what doesn't work with our marketing, whether our product or service will outperform the rest are all things we can learn through data visualizations.
