# Marketing-s-Secret-Weapon-Visual-Communication

**Visual communication**: visually displays information in order to efficiently and effectively establish meaning. When required, little text is included to explain the meaning. Simply defined, visual communication is about letting the visuals tell the narrative first, therefore whatever piece of content you create will be communicated via the design, illustration options, data visualizations, process illustrations, and so forth. 

Without words, visual communication tells our story. The absence of text should be a hallmark of any effective visual communication. Simply looking at the graphics should be enough for someone to grasp the gist of what's being discussed or conveyed in order to continue reading.
