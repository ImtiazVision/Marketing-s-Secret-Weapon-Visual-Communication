# Marketing-s-Secret-Weapon-Visual-Communication

**Visual communication**: visually displays information in order to efficiently and effectively establish meaning. When required, little text is included to explain the meaning. Simply defined, visual communication is about letting the visuals tell the narrative first, therefore whatever piece of content you create will be communicated via the design. Illustration options, data visualizations, process illustrations, and so forth.
